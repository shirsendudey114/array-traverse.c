📌 Array Traversal in C

This repository demonstrates how to traverse (iterate through) an array in the C programming language using different loop structures.

Array traversal is a fundamental concept in C programming that allows you to access and manipulate each element of an array.

Print values

Calculate sum or average

Search for elements

Modify data
